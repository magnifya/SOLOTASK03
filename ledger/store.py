"""Persistent storage: blockchain, pending set and derived indexes (JSON).

The whole state is one JSON document written atomically: a uniquely named
``.ledger-*`` snapshot is fsynced in the same directory and then promoted over
the main file with ``os.replace`` (followed by a directory fsync). Every
successful write advances a monotonic ``generation`` recorded in the
snapshot. A crash can therefore only leave behind (a) the previous main file
or (b) a fully fsynced snapshot that never got renamed — never a torn file.

On startup the main file and every sibling ``.ledger-*`` snapshot are treated
as recovery candidates. When no file exists at all, the unique genesis block
is created; otherwise each candidate is strictly validated (JSON, generation,
consecutive heights, prev_hash linkage, recomputed block hashes and Merkle
roots, per-transaction tx_id and Ed25519 signature, pending-only-at-tip and
mempool/chain de-duplication). The valid snapshot with the highest generation
wins and is promoted if it is still a temp file; same-generation content
conflicts, or a directory with no valid candidate, raise StateRecoveryError
with the offending path and reason — a fresh chain is never silently created.

One atomic write persists everything: the chain (each block carries its
confirm/rollback ``status``), a small ``state`` summary, the mempool
(``pending``), the confirmed-transaction ``index`` and the confirmed
``accounts`` activity. Derived data (index/accounts) is *rebuilt* from the
chain on every load and every save — pending blocks are excluded, so a
restart never resurrects unconfirmed transactions into balances. A
re-entrant lock serializes all updates, and a class-wide recovery lock
serializes startup scans against in-flight writes.
